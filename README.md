## Process
Every project starts with an idea. And no matter the many technological tools that are readilya available these days, pen and paper will always be the best when quickly sketching out the first drafts of a design. It doesn't need to be pretty, and in fact, is often just the opposite, but it is a great guide on how things might look, feel and interact with each other beyond what we can imagine.

With a sketch I am semi-comfortable with, I can begin to make a quick design mockup (my preferred tool for this is Adobe XD). This step is useful to set up the layout more clearly, and where the fun begins with images, fonts and colours. This is still not set in stone, and it is flexible enough for changes to be made during the developing process.
